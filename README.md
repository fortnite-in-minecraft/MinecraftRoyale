### Winning splits
The winners share all entry fees like this:
- 1st place: 50%
- 2nd place: 20%
- 3rd place: 10%
- (some charity): 20%

### Some mechanics
- There is no plot / land / faction protection.
- The worldborder shrinks for a while, then stopps, and then shrinks again until the end of the round.
- If you log in earily and then leave for a while, the worldborder might have already passed you. You will die pretty quickly if this happens.
- Your inventory is cleared between rounds. This includes health, inventory, enderchest, and more.

### Loot Chests
- Loot chests can be found throughout the map as random chests on the surface.
- They contain random loot!

### Airdrops
- Airdrops will occur at random times (though they are much more likey when more people are online).
- The coordinates will be announced in chat.
- A chest with (very good) loot will appear at those coordinates!

## Some fine print
Due to the fact that we use Patreon as our money processor, 7.9% of each purchase and $.30 goes to Patreon as the cost for the page and currency processing. This is basically unaviodable. Sorry. The actual amount that we recieve goes towards the winners and the charity. In other words, if 25 people sign up for $5 each, the first place winner will recieve less than $50.
