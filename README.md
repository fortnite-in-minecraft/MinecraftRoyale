## Some fine print
Due to the fact that we use Patreon as our money processor, 7.9% of each purchase and $.30 goes to Patreon as the cost for the page and currency processing. This is basically unaviodable. The actual amount that we recieve goes towards the winners and the charity. In other words, if 25 people sign up for $5 each, the first place winner will recieve less than $50.
